# MATLAB_Piezo_Harvesting_Model
The script generates and simulates the operation of a multi-degree of freedom piezoelectric vibration energy harvester with piezoelectric elements inserted between the oscillators.
the generated matlab scrpt takes reference from journal of "Mechanical systems and Signal Processing", article 'A dimensionless analysis of a 2DOF piezoelectric vibration energy harvester', and article "A multi-degree of freedom piezoelectric vibration energy harvester with piezoelectric elementa inserted between 2 nearby oscillators".
